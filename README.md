# Pico-ROS

Pico-ROS, is an open-source, ultra-lightweight communications stack that leverages Zenoh middleware to enable true peer-to-peer ROS topic communication on resource-constrained microcontrollers. Unlike existing solutions relying on agents, or bridges, Pico-ROS allows microcontrollers to natively participate in ROS 2 systems using rmw_zenoh. Developed initially on STM32 with Eclipse ThreadX RTOS, we have developed a hardware-agnostic version that supports various microcontrollers and Linux devices. 

Additionally, Pico-ROS provides an open-source hardware standard with a standardized connector pin out to enable creation of other Pico-ROS hardware that is compatible between manufacturers. An open hardware example that can accept Arduino shields and Grove modules, is provided.
